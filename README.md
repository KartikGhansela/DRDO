# DRDO
Human Action Recognition using LSTM and MediaPipe. Captures 30-frame pose sequences to classify actions in real-time with high accuracy. Includes keypoint extraction, preprocessing, model training, and live prediction. Lightweight, fast, and ideal for gesture-based interfaces.
üß† Human Action Recognition using LSTM Neural Networks
This project focuses on classifying human actions using a deep learning model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. It takes in sequences of extracted features (like body keypoints or motion vectors) and learns temporal patterns to predict the performed action. The implementation is done in Python using TensorFlow and Keras, and includes TensorBoard support for visualizing model performance.

üîç Overview
The system is designed to process time-series data, such as pose estimations over video frames. It uses stacked LSTM layers to learn from temporal features and dense layers to perform final classification. The model is trained on labeled sequences where each action is represented by a sequence of feature vectors.
